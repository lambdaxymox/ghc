{- Note [Superclass cycle check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The superclass cycle check for C decides if we can statically
guarantee that expanding C's superclass cycles transitively is
guaranteed to terminate.  This is a Haskell98 requirement,
but one that we lift with -XUndecidableSuperClasses.

The worry is that a superclass cycle could make the type checker loop.
More precisely, with a constraint (Given or Wanted)
    C ty1 .. tyn
one approach is to instantiate all of C's superclasses, transitively.
We can only do so if that set is finite.

This potential loop occurs only through superclasses.  This, for
example, is fine
  class C a where
    op :: C b => a -> b -> b
even though C's full definition uses C.

Making the check static also makes it conservative.  Eg
  type family F a
  class F a => C a
Here an instance of (F a) might mention C:
  type instance F [a] = C a
and now we'd have a loop.

The static check works like this, starting with C
  * Look at C's superclass predicates
  * If any is a type-function application,
    or is headed by a type variable, fail
  * If any has C at the head, fail
  * If any has a type class D at the head,
    make the same test with D

A tricky point is: what if there is a type variable at the head?
Consider this:
   class f (C f) => C f
   class c       => Id c
and now expand superclasses for constraint (C Id):
     C Id
 --> Id (C Id)
 --> C Id
 --> ....
Each step expands superclasses one layer, and clearly does not terminate.

Note [Role inference]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The role inference algorithm datatype definitions to infer the roles on the
parameters. Although these roles are stored in the tycons, we can perform this
algorithm on the built tycons, as long as we don't peek at an as-yet-unknown
roles field! Ah, the magic of laziness.

First, we choose appropriate initial roles. For families and classes, roles
(including initial roles) are N. For datatypes, we start with the role in the
role annotation (if any), or otherwise use Phantom. This is done in
initialRoleEnv1.

The function irGroup then propagates role information until it reaches a
fixpoint, preferring N over (R or P) and R over P. To aid in this, we have a
monad RoleM, which is a combination reader and state monad. In its state are
the current RoleEnv, which gets updated by role propagation, and an update
bit, which we use to know whether or not we've reached the fixpoint. The
environment of RoleM contains the tycon whose parameters we are inferring, and
a VarEnv from parameters to their positions, so we can update the RoleEnv.
Between tycons, this reader information is missing; it is added by
addRoleInferenceInfo.

There are two kinds of tycons to consider: algebraic ones (excluding classes)
and type synonyms. (Remember, families don't participate -- all their parameters
are N.) An algebraic tycon processes each of its datacons, in turn. Note that
a datacon's universally quantified parameters might be different from the parent
tycon's parameters, so we use the datacon's univ parameters in the mapping from
vars to positions. Note also that we don't want to infer roles for existentials
(they're all at N, too), so we put them in the set of local variables. As an
optimisation, we skip any tycons whose roles are already all Nominal, as there
nowhere else for them to go. For synonyms, we just analyse their right-hand sides.

irType walks through a type, looking for uses of a variable of interest and
propagating role information. Because anything used under a phantom position
is at phantom and anything used under a nominal position is at nominal, the
irType function can assume that anything it sees is at representational. (The
other possibilities are pruned when they're encountered.)

The rest of the code is just plumbing.

How do we know that this algorithm is correct? It should meet the following
specification:

Let Z be a role context -- a mapping from variables to roles. The following
rules define the property (Z |- t : r), where t is a type and r is a role:

Z(a) = r'        r' <= r
------------------------- RCVar
Z |- a : r

---------- RCConst
Z |- T : r               -- T is a type constructor

Z |- t1 : r
Z |- t2 : N
-------------- RCApp
Z |- t1 t2 : r

forall i<=n. (r_i is R or N) implies Z |- t_i : r_i
roles(T) = r_1 .. r_n
---------------------------------------------------- RCDApp
Z |- T t_1 .. t_n : R

Z, a:N |- t : r
---------------------- RCAll
Z |- forall a:k.t : r


We also have the following rules:

For all datacon_i in type T, where a_1 .. a_n are universally quantified
and b_1 .. b_m are existentially quantified, and the arguments are t_1 .. t_p,
then if forall j<=p, a_1 : r_1 .. a_n : r_n, b_1 : N .. b_m : N |- t_j : R,
then roles(T) = r_1 .. r_n

roles(->) = R, R
roles(~#) = N, N

With -dcore-lint on, the output of this algorithm is checked in checkValidRoles,
called from checkValidTycon.

Note [Role-checking data constructor arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  data T a where
    MkT :: Eq b => F a -> (a->a) -> T (G a)

Then we want to check the roles at which 'a' is used
in MkT's type.  We want to work on the user-written type,
so we need to take into account
  * the arguments:   (F a) and (a->a)
  * the context:     C a b
  * the result type: (G a)   -- this is in the eq_spec


Note [Coercions in role inference]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is (t |> co1) representationally equal to (t |> co2)? Of course they are! Changing
the kind of a type is totally irrelevant to the representation of that type. So,
we want to totally ignore coercions when doing role inference. This includes omitting
any type variables that appear in nominal positions but only within coercions.

--
-- This was silly, because the role of the abstract TyCon
-- was required to match the implementation, and the roles of
-- data types are almost never phantom.  Thus, in ticket #9204,
-- the default was changed so be representational (the most common case).  If
-- the implementing data type was actually nominal, you'd get an easy
-- to understand error, and add the role annotation yourself.
--
-- Then Backpack was added, and with it we added role *subtyping*
-- the matching judgment: if an abstract TyCon has a nominal
-- parameter, it's OK to implement it with a representational
-- parameter.  But now, the representational default is not a good
-- one, because you should *only* request representational if
-- you're planning to do coercions. To be maximally flexible
-- with what data types you will accept, you want the default
-- for hsig files is nominal.  We don't allow role subtyping
-- with hs-boot files (it's good practice to give an exactly
-- accurate role here, because any types that use the abstract
-- type will propagate the role information.)

Note [Polymorphic selectors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We take care to build the type of a polymorphic selector in the right
order, so that visible type application works according to the specification in
the GHC User's Guide (see the "Field selectors and TypeApplications" section).
We won't bother rehashing the entire specification in this Note, but the tricky
part is dealing with GADT constructor fields. Here is an appropriately tricky
example to illustrate the challenges:

  {-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}
  data T a b where
    MkT :: forall b a x.
           { field1 :: forall c. (Num a, Show c) => (Either a c, Proxy b)
           , field2 :: x
           }
        -> T a b

Our goal is to obtain the following type for `field1`:

  field1 :: forall {k} (b :: k) a.
            T a b -> forall c. (Num a, Show c) => (Either a c, Proxy b)

(`field2` is naughty, per Note [Naughty record selectors], so we cannot turn
it into a top-level field selector.)

Some potential gotchas, inspired by #18023:

1. Since the user wrote `forall b a x.` in the type of `MkT`, we want the `b`
   to appear before the `a` when quantified in the type of `field1`.
2. On the other hand, we *don't* want to quantify `x` in the type of `field1`.
   This is because `x` does not appear in the GADT return type, so it is not
   needed in the selector type.
3. Because of PolyKinds, the kind of `b` is generalized to `k`. Moreover, since
   this `k` is not written in the source code, it is inferred (i.e., not
   available for explicit type applications) and thus written as {k} in the type
   of `field1`.

In order to address these gotchas, we start by looking at the
conLikeUserTyVarBinders, which gives the order and specificity of each binder.
This effectively solves (1) and (3). To solve (2), we filter the binders to
leave only those that are needed for the selector type.

Note [Naughty record selectors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A "naughty" field is one for which we can't define a record
selector, because an existential type variable would escape.  For example:
        data T = forall a. MkT { x,y::a }
We obviously can't define
        x (MkT v _) = v
Nevertheless we *do* put a RecSelId into the type environment
so that if the user tries to use 'x' as a selector we can bleat
helpfully, rather than saying unhelpfully that 'x' is not in scope.
Hence the sel_naughty flag, to identify record selectors that don't really exist.

In general, a field is "naughty" if its type mentions a type variable that
isn't in the result type of the constructor.  Note that this *allows*
GADT record selectors (Note [GADT record selectors]) whose types may look
like     sel :: T [a] -> a

For naughty selectors we make a dummy binding
   sel = ()
so that the later type-check will add them to the environment, and they'll be
exported.  The function is never called, because the typechecker spots the
sel_naughty field.

Note [GADT record selectors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For GADTs, we require that all constructors with a common field 'f' have the same
result type (modulo alpha conversion).  [Checked in GHC.Tc.TyCl.checkValidTyCon]
E.g.
        data T where
          T1 { f :: Maybe a } :: T [a]
          T2 { f :: Maybe a, y :: b  } :: T [a]
          T3 :: T Int

and now the selector takes that result type as its argument:
   f :: forall a. T [a] -> Maybe a

Details: the "real" types of T1,T2 are:
   T1 :: forall r a.   (r~[a]) => a -> T r
   T2 :: forall r a b. (r~[a]) => a -> b -> T r

So the selector loooks like this:
   f :: forall a. T [a] -> Maybe a
   f (a:*) (t:T [a])
     = case t of
         T1 c   (g:[a]~[c]) (v:Maybe c)       -> v `cast` Maybe (right (sym g))
         T2 c d (g:[a]~[c]) (v:Maybe c) (w:d) -> v `cast` Maybe (right (sym g))
         T3 -> error "T3 does not have field f"

Note the forall'd tyvars of the selector are just the free tyvars
of the result type; there may be other tyvars in the constructor's
type (e.g. 'b' in T2).

Note the need for casts in the result!

All this applies to updaters (see Note [Record updaters]) as well as selectors;
in the example above we will build this updater:
    $upd:f:T1 :: T [a] -> (Maybe a -> T [a], Maybe a)

If a GADT field has bona-fide existential tyvars that do not appear in the
result type, the selector will be naughty (see Note [Naughty record selectors]).


Note [Selector running example]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's OK to combine GADTs and type families.  Here's a running example:

        data instance T [a] where
          T1 { fld :: b } :: T [Maybe b]

The representation type looks like this
        data :R7T a where
          T1 { fld :: b } :: :R7T (Maybe b)

and there's coercion from the family type to the representation type
        :CoR7T a :: T [a] ~ :R7T a

The selector we want for fld looks like this:

        fld :: forall b. T [Maybe b] -> b
        fld = /\b. \(d::T [Maybe b]).
              case d `cast` :CoR7T (Maybe b) of
                T1 (x::b) -> x

The scrutinee of the case has type :R7T (Maybe b), which can be
gotten by applying the eq_spec to the univ_tvs of the data con.

Note [Impredicative record selectors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are situations where generating code for record selectors requires the
use of ImpredicativeTypes. Here is one example (adapted from #18005):

  type S = (forall b. b -> b) -> Int
  data T = MkT {unT :: S}
         | Dummy

We want to generate HsBinds for unT that look something like this:

  unT :: S
  unT (MkT x) = x
  unT _       = recSelError "unT"#

Note that the type of recSelError is `forall r (a :: TYPE r). Addr# -> a`.
Therefore, when used in the right-hand side of `unT`, GHC attempts to
instantiate `a` with `(forall b. b -> b) -> Int`, which is impredicative.
To make sure that GHC is OK with this, we enable ImpredicativeTypes interally
when typechecking these HsBinds so that the user does not have to.

Although ImpredicativeTypes is somewhat fragile and unpredictable in GHC right
now, it will become robust when Quick Look impredicativity is implemented. In
the meantime, using ImpredicativeTypes to instantiate the `a` type variable in
recSelError's type does actually work, so its use here is benign.


Note [Record updaters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given a datatype declaration, we generate a record selector and also a "record
updater" for each field.  For a record type `r` containing a field type `a`, the
updater will have type

    r -> (a -> r, a)

where the first component of the pair sets the field and the second component
returns the existing value.  For example, given the data declaration

    data T y = MkT { foo :: [y], bar :: Int }

we generate the record updaters:

    $upd:foo:MkT :: T y -> ([y] -> T y, [y])
    $upd:foo:MkT (MkT { foo = x1, bar = x2})
        = (\y -> MkT { foo = y, bar = x2}, x1)

    $upd:bar:MkT :: T y -> (Int -> T y, Int)
    $upd:bar:MkT (MkT { foo = x1, bar = x2 })
        = (\y -> MkT { foo = x1, bar = y}, x2)

These are used to produce instances of GHC.Records.HasField automatically as
described in Note [HasField instances] in GHC.Tc.Instance.Class.

Note that:

 * The updater's OccName is prefixed with $upd: so it is never valid in user
   code. Its Name never appears in the AvailInfo or GlobalRdrEnv; instead an
   updater is considered to be in scope iff the corresponding field label is in
   scope.

 * The Name of each updater is stored alongside that of the selector in the
   'FieldLabel's in each 'DataCon'.  See the notes in GHC.Types.FieldLabel.

 * Renamed-syntax bindings for both a selector and an updater for each field are
   produced by mkRecordSelectorAndUpdater; these bindings are then type-checked
   together normally.

 * We produce renamed syntax rather than attempting to generate Core terms
   directly because the corresponding Core terms are rather complex.  This is
   because they include the code necessary to evaluate strict fields, and to
   pack/unpack UNPACKed fields, i.e. everything that is handled by the
   constructor wrapper, and by dataConBoxer when desugaring pattern matching.
   See Note [Generating updaters in advance].

 * In some cases we may not be able to generate an updater and will bind its
   name to () instead, even if we can generate the corresponding selector.  See
   Note [Naughty record updaters].

 * We could imagine generating the selector *from* the updater, i.e. build
       $sel:foo:T r = case $upd:foo:T r of (_, x) -> x
   but we don't do so because the updater might be naughty, and for pattern
   synonyms will not exist at all (see Note [No updaters for pattern synonyms]).

 * For GADTs, we insist that all constructors mentioning a field have the same
   type, and reject the definition entirely if not.  Thus if the field does not
   involve an existential (and hence is not naughty) we can make both a selector
   and an updater (see Note [GADT record selectors]).


Note [Naughty record updaters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a few cases in which we cannot generate an updater for a field:

1. The field has an existential tyvar, e.g.
     data T = forall a . MkT { foo :: a }
   This is the same as for selectors (see Note [Naughty record selectors]).

2. The field is higher-rank, e.g.
     data T = MkT { foo :: forall a . a -> a }
   as this would require an impredicative instantiation of (,).

3. The field kind is not Type, e.g.
     data T = MkT { foo :: Addr# }
   as this would require an ill-kinded application of (,).

Every field with a naughty record selector also has a naughty record updater
(because the condition 1 is the same for both).  However, some types will have a
naughty updater but a regular selector (where conditions 2 or 3 apply).

If any of these apply, we bind $upd:foo:MkT to (), just as a naughty record
selector is bound to (). This means that when trying to generate a HasField
instance, we need to check if the updater is () and if so give up.


Note [Generating updaters in advance]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We generate a selector and updater for every field when compiling a datatype
declaration, even though this costs a bit of type-checking time.  Why don't we
do this at HasField constraint solving time instead, at least for updaters?

 * For types with bangs and unboxing, it's not entirely simple to generate the
   selector or updater in Core form directly. The current mechanism generates
   them in source code form and compiles it.

 * Some uses of selectors and updaters will inline, but some will not, e.g.
     f x = (x.a, x.b)  -- RecordDotSyntax notation, or
     g x = setField @"a" x ()
   and making a new copy of a perhaps complex updater every time seems
   wasteful.  As soon as we have an updater that is not inlined at 2 or more
   call sites, we win (even on compile time) vs inlining it everywhere


Note [No updaters for pattern synonyms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For record pattern synonyms, we generate a selector function, but not an
updater.  In principle it would be possible to build an updater for
bidirectional pattern synonyms, but not for unidirectional ones.  In any case,
the updater function is not necessary because we do not solve HasField
constraints for fields defined by pattern synonyms.

That is, given

    pattern MkPair{x,y} = (x, y)

you can use `x` as a "record selector" in an expression.  But the constraint
solver will not automatically solve constraints like `HasField "x" (a, b) a`, so
you cannot directly use expressions such as `getField @"x" (True, False)` or
`setField @"x" p False`, and RecordDotSyntax will not natively support record
pattern synonyms.

This can be worked around by the user user manually writing an explicit
HasField instance, such as

   instance HasField "x" (a,b) a where
      hasField (x,y) = (\x' -> (x',y), x)

which will be subject to the usual rules around orphan instances and the
restrictions on when HasField instances can be defined (as described in
Note [Validity checking of HasField instances] in GHC.Tc.Validity).

We could imagine allowing (bidirectional) record pattern synonyms to lead to
automatic HasField constraint solving, but this potentially introduces
incoherent HasField instances, because multiple pattern synonyms (in different
modules) might use the same field name in the same type, and would even lead to
e.g.

    pattern Id{id} = id

introducing an `id` field to *every* type!

Given the possibility of incoherence, and the fact that a reasonable workaround
exists, we do not currently solve HasField constraints for fields defined by
pattern synonyms.  And since we do not need updaters for anything other than
solving HasField constraints, we do not generate them for pattern synonyms.

When type-checking record update bindings, we need to be able to look up the

used in the definitions.  However, for data constructors in data family
instances the tcl_env contains placeholder bindings added to prevent the use of
promotion (see Note [AFamDataCon: not promoting data family constructors] in
GHC.Tc.Utils.Env).  Thus we must remove them again before the call to
tcRecSelBinds in addTyConsToGblEnv.
